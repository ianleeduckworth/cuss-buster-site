          <p>
            Cussbuster is an API that can be called programatically. You pass it
            a string of text and it will flag any inappropriate words. That's it! It
            is fast, secure, and efficient while still being very easy to use.

          <h3>Focus on what is important to you</h3>
          <p>
            Tracking down every single bad word is an icky task.
            It involves aggregating every awful word people say into your own
            blacklist as well as keeping track of any new bad words as they are
            created. Leave this unenviable task up to us. We make understanding
            foul language our business so that you can focus on yours.
